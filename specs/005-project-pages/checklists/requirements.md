# Specification Quality Checklist: Project Pages

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-09-06
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Revalidated on 2026-09-06 after synchronizing the specification with the current project-page source.
- Validation passed on the first synchronization review. No clarification markers remain.
- FR-020 records the constitution's Git-backend constraint as a product boundary without prescribing page implementation details.
- User Story 4 and FR-021 through FR-027 cover the implemented project workspace, project-local navigation state, history presentation, toolbar action requests, and accessibility semantics.
- Development-only project seeding and machine-specific sample paths are intentionally excluded because they are test scaffolding rather than user-facing product requirements.
